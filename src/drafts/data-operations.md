## __binary spatial relations__

These ask binary (true or false) questions about a spatial relationship between two geometry objects. They define criteria used to query (filter, select) geometry objects.

## __vector overlay operations__  

These compare two geometric zones on two layers and create a new output layer with geometries or features made from one or two parent geometries.

# introduction    

This is a collection of recurring tasks that can be implemented with the javascript code editor for Google Earth Engine.  

In many cases, the snippets use data and tools that are shared via my public earth engine repo. Click [__here__][myRepo]{target=_blank} to add the repository to the "Reader" section in your instance of Code Editor. This will allow you to see the underlying code.
